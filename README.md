# fortran-algo-for-trading-in-the-stock-market

A little bit of my development history. This project tells the story of how I studied to learn to code in Fortran. The project objective was to develop an algorithm that would help me make better trading decisions. I have since moved to python so I will be no longer working with this fortran project.
